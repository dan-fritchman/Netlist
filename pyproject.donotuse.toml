# # Python Project Config 
# 
# Note this pyproject.toml *is not* used directly, except to generate `setup.py` with `poetry2setup > setup.py`. 
# While `poetry` is great and we love it, and especially love TOML instead of Python for configuration, 
# it's not quite ready for prime time with respect to a few features we use. 
# Especially *editable installs*, i.e. those generated with `pip install -e .`. 
# Note generating these editable installs depends on *not* having a `pyproject.toml` file present, 
# or `pip` generally chokes. Hence the alternate name of this ostensible `pyproject.toml` file. 
# Running `poetry2setup`, which does not as of this writing accept a command-line TOML configuration input, 
# therefore requires temporarily renaming this file to `pyproject.toml`.
